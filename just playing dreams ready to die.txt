[Verse 1]
As I sit back relax, steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail for fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly, Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans they fitting like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses, I'mma show you
Who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a pinch of hardcore with a gun
Pimping ain't easy but it sure is fun
When I bust my nuts I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun?

[Chorus]
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying

[Verse 2]
I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck RuPaul before I fuck them ugly ass Xscape bitches
You can 76 the 69, try 68
Make Raven-Symon√© call date rape
Only cause Im paid, I'm fucking all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
"Everybody move your body"
Got Whitney Houston boosting from Bobby
As I bust the cherry of Monica and Terry
Backshots to Chaka, I know that pussy hairy
Sade, ooh, I know that pussy tight
Smack Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke a stoge, fucking En Vogue because it's four of them
Jimmy hats for Patra, I'm using all of them
(What about Toni Braxton?)
If that bitch give me action...guaranteed satisfaction

[Chorus]
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
Dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
I'm just playing... I'm saying
